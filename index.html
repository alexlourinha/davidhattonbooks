                <strong>The interview below was originally published by <em><a href="http://www.whatsgoodtoread.co.uk/interview-with-david-hatton/">whatsgoodtoread.co.uk</a></em></strong>
                <br>
                <br>David Hatton is a relatively new author and has just published his fourth novel, I have had the privilege of reading the last two; The Catfish and The Exhumation and really enjoyed them – completely different stories from each other. His other titles are The Return and The Medium.
                <br>
                David was born in Preston, Lancashire and has lived in Leeds, Manchester and even Chicago before finding home in Horwich.
                <br>
                Thank for agreeing to talk to me, taking time out of your busy schedule.
                <br><br>
                <strong><em>When did you start writing?</em>
                </strong><br>
                When I was in primary school, we were asked to write stories every week and the teacher read out the best ones. She always read mine out and said I should write a book. On my last day of school, I gave her a card and in it I wrote that if I ever published a novel, I would send her a signed copy. I kept that promise twenty years later! I didn’t write after that for a long time until I moved to America and I blogged about my time over there. People fed back about my writing and seemed to be really engaged with it. I started jotting some ideas about but it would be another ten years before I published my first book.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong><em>When was your first novel published?</em>
                </strong><br>
                May 2018. I turned 30 and thought I’m going to finally finish that novel and get it out!
                <br><br>
                <strong><em>Are you a full-time author or do you have another job as well?</em>
                </strong><br>
                In my ‘day job’ I’m a Recruitment Manager for a large retail chain.
                <br><br>
                <strong><em>How long does it typically take you to write a book and has it been easier or harder during lockdowns?</em>
                </strong><br>
                Usually end-to-end it’s about 6 months and I like a few months off after that to generate ideas and spend some time marketing the book. Lockdown definitely gave me the gift of time. I usually aim for one book a year, but as there was very little else to do this year, I published two this year.
                <br><br>
                <strong><em>I have just finished reading The Exhumation, why did you decide to write a story based around digging up a dead president?
                </em><br></strong>
                In 2009, I was living in Chicago and I visited Springfield Illinois where he is buried. There was a sign there describing the true story of an attempted theft of Abraham’s body in 1876. I started to imagine ‘what if someone tried that today?’ I then later heard conspiracy theories about Lincoln and his true intentions for the slaves and the two just seemed to merge together into one story.
                <br><br>
                <strong><em>All your books have very different themes, where do you get your ideas from?
                </em><br></strong>
                I constantly have the news on. I also love a good conspiracy theory. I also believe the location is a key part of my book, almost as an extra character so I spend time learning about places which usually inspires some of the story.
                <br>
                The Return was inspired by true attempted claims of life insurance after 9/11 – we don’t know if anyone has successfully attempted it, but so many people disappeared that day it is possible. My mind went to the question of what a family would do if a loved one they presumed was dead came back? It was hard not to be inspired by the famous canoe man too who did just that!
                <br>
                The Medium was inspired by Derren Brown who did a show on psychics. I went and visited a famous psychic medium on her tour too and it was eye opening.
                <br>
                The Catfish was based on a Channel 4 documentary in which they followed predator hunter gangs on their quest to expose people online.
                <br><br>
                <strong><em>You seem to like two-word titles for your books, is there a reason behind this or do you just like short, to the point titles?
                </em><br></strong>
                I think it started off with The Return and then The Medium and suddenly it just stuck. My next one is actually a three-word title (in progress)! I’m very orderly and like things to look neat and tidy so when all my books are lined up I can clearly see they’re all mine…. Plus, I like to be to the point and so people know what it’s generally about.
                <br><br>
                <strong><em>Have you started writing your next book yet?
                </em><br></strong>
                Yes, just this weekend. I have a jot book of ideas which are all used up now (well the good ones… ‘Celebrity Death Island’ won’t ever see the light of day!) so I’ve had to start a fresh. I won’t reveal too much at the moment in case I get halfway through and delete it because it’s terrible, which I’ve done with another book recently. Hopefully it’ll be out in the summer or autumn next year.
                <br><br>
                <strong><em>What other authors inspire you?
                    <br>
                </em></strong>Lynwood Barclay is my absolute favourite. I love novels which are fast paced, great holiday reads and perfect for the poolside. One of the reasons I began writing again was due to my friend, Kerry Wilkinson, who is now an international success selling millions of copies. I’m in awe. I mentioned it to him years ago and he said I should just do it. I know he got to 30 and evaluated his life too, which in turn gave me a kick up the backside to do it myself.
                <br><br>
                <strong><em>And finally, the hardest question. Do you have a favourite author or book, or do they continually change the more books that you read?
                </em><br></strong>
                It was Lynwood Barclay’s ‘No Time For Goodbye’ until he released ‘Elevator Pitch’ last year which is by far his greatest work. I can’t wait for his next novel in February.</p>
